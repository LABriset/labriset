Abstract

The aim of this paper is to examine how public and international pressures affect the
education policy in Indonesia. The method used in collecting data was by utilizing
secondary data and compiling news from international finding. The news compilation
was analyzed using discourse analysis to depict the public pressure to change the
curriculum in Indonesia.

Introduction

Education is a program that can be linked with teaching and learning certain
disciplines in order to understand the accumulated science in the world. To manage the
education into the process of transferring knowledge it needs a system, policy, and
assessment to classify which first study the students will receive.
While education in Indonesia is identical with memorizing formulas and
concepts without acknowledging what’s behind things the students learn about. The
direction of learning science 90% concentrate to achieve the score but there’s weakness
in the science learning process in Indonesia (Dwianto et al, 2017). Indonesian students
have less understanding towards the natural world and science, the lack of ability to 
identify scientific issues, elaborate phenomena scientifically, and use scientific proof
are included (Suprapto, 2016). The downfall over Indonesia’s Literacy Achievement
performed by OECD in latest PISA, 2018, had handed Kemdikbud another homework
and might add some more serious job to do. Is the downfall preventable? It might be
yes to answer the question. Bunch of researches already mentioned the same important
factors that lead the leveling of its program.
Looking at education reality in Indonesia experienced generic change in the last
century, the government took a chance on making the education system decentralized
by implementing a renewable curriculum to increase student’s cognitive achievement.
What is happening in Indonesia’s literacy results in PISA 2018 should have changed its
education system, assessment and policy to encourage and increase Indonesian
student’s achievement.
By a centralized education system and assessment under government policy, the
government must have looked at how the teaching styles and the value of learning affect
student’s attainment. All the authors behind Indonesia's education system and policy
need to reform the vision of being acknowledged and define that education is not only
about passing high scores and memorizing the entire disciplines, yet on how to educate
the students to understand the meaning, the value, the reason why they have to be
insightful. Here is the discussion over finding factors to be fixed towards reforming
Indonesia education system and policy.

Theory

Known as a country that has plenty of local cultures, it will wrench Indonesia’s
cultural imagery if this country gets caught not integrating local wisdom or cultural
heritage in its education system. Students simply misunderstood that local wisdom
subject in their school only for introducing the culture from generation to generation,
whilst in the making batik has science elements to learn (Atmojo, 2015). Other than
that, any previous research found the causes of Indonesia’s PISA achievement barrier.
Stacey (2011), reported in an article if mathematical literacy is linked with some certain
factors such as social-economic background, parental education, equity, gender, and
school climate. The latest article from Wibowo, and friends (2020) prove those factors
are still accurate to be used in recent education papers.
Sahlberg (2011) explained four simple way on Finland’s education policies that
can be adapted into Indonesia’s further education policies, the fourth ways of Finland
are inspiration and innovation, also responsibility and sustainability. Rosser (2018)
informed the reasons why Indonesia should improve its education system to build better
learning outcomes because; inadequate funding, human resource deficits, perverse
incentive structures, and poor management. Three International development
organizations such as World Bank, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have recommended
that the Indonesian Government increase education funding, improve teacher training,
and reform education administration.
In order to perceive the education circumstances encounter, the authorized
government should be competent to compare its education system with other countries
such as Finland; that has achieved its high performances in PISA with consistency of
educational provision, high-quality and highly educated teachers, an education
system based on trust and autonomy, egalitarian values of the country and political
consensus in education. The Finns have also exhibited patience when implementing
education policy, adhering to the mantra of community and change- for example,
waiting a generation to assess the efficacious of major education reform (Chung, 2009).
Finland has achieved these high PISA outcomes while ‘going against the grain’ of
recent worrying educational trends, such as The Global Education Reform (GERM)
(Sahlberg, 2011). Better communication must occur between policy-makers, academics,
and practitioners. Furthermore, tackling and preventing these ‘quick fix’ policy
decisions require direct interaction between comparativist and politicans (Chung, 2015).
Based on previous studies it shows variables to measure achievement (PISA)
and analyze common education systems and assessment such as Finland's finding
system by making its own strong program from educational experience it has been faced.
This study will focus on digging-depth information provided by data PISA 2018 to
acknowledge the credible result and analysis of Indonesian student achievement, then
compare the common Indonesia education assessment to Southeast countries and
Finland.
This finding is also to discover the answer of these questions: 1) Do school
climate and subjective well-being affect student achievement? 2) How is the downfall
of Indonesia’s student achievement can be an excuse to reform its education system and
policy? and 3) What are things can be looked from other countries to improve its
education system?
